## About The Project
I've developed this challenge to learn React with Hooks and practice my skills.

In this project I'm using:

* HTML & CSS
* Mobile First
* Responsive Design

### Acknowledgments

- [Sass Tutorial for Beginners - freecodecamp.org](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a5j7KoflTs&t=392s) - This masterclass helped understand @mixin, @function, @include, @extend, etc. Sass features to improve the project organization and avoid repetitions. Will keep using them going forward.
